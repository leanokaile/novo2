  <h1>My dearest continent,</h1>

  <p>
    You have taught me that 2025 wasn't so bad after all. It was tolerable because I had you to play my memories of it on repeat. I'm still impressed with your consistency, how you were able to tolerate my personality is something worth being a thesis topic. I would've expected you to give up on me just like the others did, but you stood firm. You're gonna be a wonderful woman in the future---you already are! 
  </p>

  <p>
    yow!
